I've got it.  It all boils down to riverRank.  Run enough simulations so you have sufficient data
for a given riverRank and handType: % chance of winning at a given riverRank.
Then run hand rank predictions down to the river, and that array gives the number of occurences of
each riverRank, and that gives you an aggregate of your chance of winning.

Preflop aggregate should be equivalent to total wins vs losses.

So I need to write handRanker predictors:
* preflop-->river (size = 108100)
* flop-->river (size = 2162)
* turn-->river (size = 46) <-- I already have this function.


Preflop
    Inputs [1]:
        * Hand (e.g. AKu, 87s, 44)
    Outputs:
        * % Chance of winning

Flop
    Inputs [99]:
        * Hand (e.g. AKu, 87s, 44)
        * Hand rank
        * Rank predict array metadata
            ** Mean
            ** Standard Deviation
            ** Skewness
            ** RPA accumulation array [47]
            ** RPA accumulation sum array [47]
    Outputs:
        * % Chance of winning

Turn
    Inputs [97]:
        * Hand (e.g. AKu, 87s, 44)
        * Hand rank
        * Rank predict array metadata
            ** Mean
            ** Standard Deviation
            ** Skewness
            ** RPA accumulation array [46]
            ** RPA accumulation sum array [46]
    Outputs:
        * % Chance of winning

River
    Inputs [95]:
        * Hand (e.g. AKu, 87s, 44)
        * Hand rank
        * Rank predict array metadata
            ** Mean
            ** Standard Deviation
            ** Skewness
            ** RPA accumulation array [45]
            ** RPA accumulation sum array [45]
    Outputs:
        * % Chance of winning
