DESCRIPTION

This is a No-Limit Texas Hold-em Poker analysis tool & game engine based in C++11.


DEPENDENCIES

Requires postgres to be installed on user's machine
* currently hard-coded to user: dsuser, password 123, database dsdata
Designed to be platform independent
* platform-dependent functions are kept in osRelated files in core
* currently only POSIX has been implemented
* there is only one platform-dependent function currently in use


COMPONENTS - COMPLETED

* Multi-threading game engine
* Hand-ranking algorithm
    * Provides an exact rank given a set of hole cards and board
* Cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator (CSPRNG) and interface
* postgres interface for handling statistics and other generated data


COMPONENTS - IN-PROGRESS

* Dictionary, Entry, Token, Itstream classes for easy file input / output and settings management.


COMPONENTS - TODO

* Create detailed hand-rank tables
    * Input variables:
        * Number of players
        * Position
        * Players that have acted (fold, call, raise)
        * Player actions simulated using input variables:
            * Raise and call thresholds based on hole card strength (Chen), current bet level, and
                    position (with statistical variability applied to each player)
            * Bluff (or mistake) percentage
    * Output variables:
        * Win / lose
        * Hand rank at flop, turn and river
        * Hand rank predection and flop and turn
    * Create meta data of output variables (average, stddev, histogram)
    * Perform gradient descent on meta variables to find best win predictors
    This task will help make more sense of hand rank & prediction, and preflop hole cards

* Create player database framework

* Create interface with online game
